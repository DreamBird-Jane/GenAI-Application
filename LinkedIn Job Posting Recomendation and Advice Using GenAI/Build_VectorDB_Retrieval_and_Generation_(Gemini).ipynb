By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.\\n\\nOur customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams.

And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.\\n\\nRecycling and Waste\\n\\nWe continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions.

In addition, we have two product candidates in preclinical studies: 4D-175 for geographic atrophy (GA) and 4D-725 for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\\n\\nTo-date, we have demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept for three evolved vectors in three therapeutic areas and routes of administration with five products and patient populations. We believe this validates the power of our directed evolution platform for discovering superior vectors compared to wildtype viral vectors. We have built a robust and efficient product engine with 6 open Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) in the U.S., 1 IND in Taiwan, and 1 Clinical Trial Approval (CTA) in Australia. We believe we are positioned to create, develop, manufacture and, if approved, effectively commercialize targeted genetic medicines that could transform the lives of patients suffering from debilitating diseases.\\n\\nIn addition to TVE, our technology includes a robust AAV manufacturing platform and onsite manufacturing facility that allows us to rapidly produce and test research grade material and scale up to GMP clinical material. This internal capability and close collaboration between our R&D and Manufacturing teams has greatly accelerated the pace of discovery at 4DMT.\\n\\nCompany Differentiators:\\n\\n Fully integrated clinical-phase company with internal manufacturing Demonstrated ability to move rapidly from idea to IND Five candidate products in the clinic and two declared pre-clinical programs Robust technology and IP foundation, including our TVE and manufacturing platforms Initial product safety and efficacy data substantiates the value of our platforms Opportunities to expand to other indications and modalities within genetic medicine\\n\\nGENERAL SUMMARY: \\n\\nPrincipal Data Scientist: Biostatistics will report to the VP, Data Science and will focus on providing strategic input and technical expertise on statistical methodology to support the research and development organization for assigned projects They will participate as active members of a cross-functional team to plan, lead and execute the tasks required to support the clinical development for the assigned programs.\\n\\nRESPONSIBILITIES: \\n\\nProvide statistical expertise and collaborate with various functions on study design/planning, protocol development, statistical methodology/analysisResponsible for the development of statistical analysis plan (SAP), TFL shells and other analysis specifications on assigned studiesResponsible for the development of randomization schema on assigned randomized studiesPerform data analysis and/or collaborate with statistical programming (inhouse or vendor) to ensure quality analysis conducted per the SAP and specificationsResponsible for the development of statistical reports summarizing the data analysis resultsEnsure adequate interpretation of data/analysis results and consistency/accuracy of data presentation for study reports and publicationsProvide statistical input, including authoring the relevant sections, to various documents for regulatory submissions (e.g., pre-meeting briefing documents, CSRs) and/or publicationsMay act as a statistical programmer for inhouse data analysis as neededCollaborate with various functions to ensure robust CRF/EDC development, and quality data collection for the assigned clinical trialsOversee the biometrics vendors to ensure the prompt and quality statistical deliverablesProvide quality review of outsourced statistical deliverables (including inhouse double programming to QC as needed) and coordinate the inhouse review commentsContribute to the development of functional-level standards, SOPs, and work instructions and templatesRepresent both biostatistics and statistical programming on study/project teamsStay abreast of industry development in biostatistics/statistical programming fields and apply to appropriate systems and processesOther duties as assigned, nothing in this job description restricts management’s right to assign or reassign duties and responsibilities to this job at any time \\n\\nQUALIFICATIONS: \\n\\nEducation:\\n\\n12 years of related experience with a Bachelor’s degree;
